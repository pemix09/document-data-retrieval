To obtain a sanitary booklet, one must submit material to be tested and wait for the results. The process takes approximately 1-2 weeks. After receiving the results, one can schedule an appointment with a doctor of medicine who has a positive opinion from the sanitary inspectorate. The entire process includes three stages: submitting the material, conducting tests on samples, and issuing a verdict.
