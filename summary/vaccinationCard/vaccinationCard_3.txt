The e-card of vaccinations allows for electronic documentation of patient medical records for each vaccination. It works within the framework of the gabinet.gov.pl application, which enables management of referrals to vaccinations, recording of qualification results, and creation of an e-card of vaccinations. The benefits include monitoring the state of vaccine consumption and patients can check their vaccination status after logging in to their Internet Patient Account.
