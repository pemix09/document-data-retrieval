This is a mandate contract, one of the most commonly used forms of employment by employers. It aims to achieve the tasks assigned with due diligence. The contract should include details such as the parties involved (name, surname, PESEL, personal ID numbers, address), the subject matter of the contract (specific task and its characteristics), and the duration of the contract (either a specific time frame or until certain circumstances arise). The remuneration may be specified in the contract or according to the task's value. It can also take the form of service exchange. The payment should occur after the completion of the task, but both parties can agree on an alternative term.
