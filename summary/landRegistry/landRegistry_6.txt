The request must be filled out legibly, using printed characters, without erasures or corrections. The applicant only fills out the clear fields of the request and leaves uncompleted fields blank. The request is submitted to the central office or branch of the Central Information Office of Land Registers. A request that is not properly completed will incur a fee lower than the one owed. Without attaching the original proof of payment, its copy, or printout, the process will be suspended. The applicant will be notified.
