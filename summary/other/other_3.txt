The document discusses changes to the rules for access to firearms. The Ruch Obywatelski Miłośników Broni (Citizens' Movement of Firearms Enthusiasts) is considering two options for storing and using firearms by soldiers: either in existing military units or in free spaces in police and other law enforcement agencies' storage facilities. The proposed solution requires broad social consultations, legal and organizational changes in the Polish Armed Forces, making it possible to implement only after a few years.
