The Office of the Ombudsman for Civil Rights informs that the complaint filed by Mr. Rafał Krzyształowski was recognized and considered in the case concerning the proceedings before the Regional Court in Wałcz, where a motion to impose a fine for minor offenses was filed against Mr. Krzyształowski and his son Mariusz. The court's decision was based on the opinion of an expert psychiatrist, which was allowed due to doubts about the defendant's mental capacity. The Ombudsman's Office did not assess the validity of the expert's opinion.
